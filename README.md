### build status
![Main Project Build Status](https://github.com/meowFlute/project_euler/actions/workflows/makefile.yml/badge.svg)

### unit test status
I don't have unit tests yet (I've only just made this repo today) so this is just a placeholder

## What is this repo?
Just solving the problems at https://projecteuler.net/ for fun. I'll do it in C and/or Fortran and use it as an excuse to do some things in CUDA and OpenCL because that is part of the fun.
